# Quant Physics

Welcome to Quant Physics. This is a python wrapper allowing us to run analysis, backtesting, and execution of trades. You should be already added to the Notion + Slack. Look at the ðŸ’¡ Learning Guide if you're confused about anything.

Also you should have a branch added for yourself. You will only contribute to that branch and mergers will be handled at group meeting / case by case basis.

## Installation
You can install Quant Physics via the git tool (a package manager).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantphysics/quant_physics
```
GIT will always install the latest version. Note: it will NOT handle dependencies automatically.
